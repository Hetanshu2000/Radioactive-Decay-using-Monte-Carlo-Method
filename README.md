# Radioactive-Decay-using-Monte-Carlo-Method
In this Project we analyse the radioactive decay of an element using the Monte Carlo method. We have first consider a single element’s decay and later on have simulated successive decay of 225Ra. We have also developed our code to obtained the average number of particle decay in the first iteration (ie first unit of time) and have observed the Poisson’s curve for it.
